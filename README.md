# Graph-Algorithms

the implementation of the most popular Graph Algorithms(dijkstra, bellmanFord, floydWarshall).
and a command line interface for interaction with the Algorithms.

dijkstra(int source):
Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in the graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.
Returns an array of distances from the source node to all other nodes in the graph.

bellmanFord(int source):
Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in the graph using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
Returns an array of distances from the source node to all other nodes in the graph, or null if a negative cycle exists.

floydWarshall():
Finds the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in the graph using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
Returns a 2D array of shortest path distances between all pairs of nodes in the graph.
